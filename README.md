# Repository for Machine Learning Path

Machine Learning Cohorts are involved in gathering, cleaning, and preprocess required data, and the most important is building Neural Network models. Tensorflow would be our main tools.

We were planning to make 2 DNN models, the purposes are listed here.

1. Predict disease based on the symptoms. To achieve this, there is a plan to make 2 different versions of the model. First is a strict version, where the symptoms are predefined and limited by our scope, and the other is using Embedding to handle the limitation. This would allow user to choose whether if the symptoms choices are enough, or they prefer to input the symptoms by themselves in a free-text format.

2. (Postponed) QnA-Based Chatbot to answer questions related to mental health. To achieve this, we would do fine-tuning or transfer learning from pre-trained model.
